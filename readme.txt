Hospital Managment System
Our project that is “Hospital management System” performs all the major tasks present in any hospital. The program is unique in a sense that it is programmed so that it can be used by all manager,doctor and patient to view their appropriate fields. It has an manager with unique id and password to login  into the program. Then the program allows to take the information of patient (name, age, address, blood group, gender, phone Number, disease etc ). The option to select disease is done by showing different diseases with their respective doctor and fees. It then saves all the date into file. It can also view patient from the file. There are 3 different types of patient that is check up patient, admit patient, surgery patient. It calculates the fees of patient according to the disease and patient type . It also has the ward so the admit patient bill is further improvised by calculating days he/she spent in hospital. It then adds the fees of ward according to rooms after calculating them into the patient bill. It also calculates the doctor salary after adding fix salary plus per patient bonus. Moreover there is also field for separate service patient who doesn’t use doctor but other services like blood test, x-ray, stool test etc.
